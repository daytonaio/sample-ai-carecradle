## ❓ Problem Statement

Nepal's maternal mortality rate (MMR) remains alarmingly high at **151 per 100,000 live births**, with even higher rates in rural areas like **Lumbini** and **Karnali provinces**. Women face preventable pregnancy-related complications due to:  
- Gaps in knowledge and timely access to information.  
- Limited availability of qualified healthcare professionals.  
- Traditional practices and social stigmas.

These challenges result in tragic outcomes, particularly in marginalized communities.
